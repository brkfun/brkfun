**Yo!** I'm a `G.O.A.T` focused on *Every shit that i've playing with* , *Docker* , *Kubernetes* , 
*Laravel PHP Framework* and *OTHERS* Kappa. Not a revolutionary person but want to know everything latest 

I was at the way ***"you've been in"*** scared from coding because of the, quote on quote **old DEVELOPERS**.
we are in the same path, but if you turn at the wrong side of quality i will be there to drop you dead.

I'm ruthless, I'm dangerous, I'm serial killer nothing more than that. 

I'm not a developer, i am an artist who designs the best mechanic possible at the time around for the deadline. 

I'm not professional, professions you've been looking for, already becomes **Curse** for me.

I'm an athlete which doesnt try to run faster try to run stable and act always trouble. My motto always will be;
``If everyone tells you "You are perfect" that means you are not perfect enough, but if everyone hates you that means you are perfect.``
