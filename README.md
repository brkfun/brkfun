**Yo!** I'm a `G.O.A.T` focused on *Everything that i've playing with* , *Docker* , *Kubernetes* , 
*Laravel PHP Framework* , *Node* , *Python* and *OTHERS*. Not a revolutionary person but want to know everything latest.

I was at the way ***"you've been in"*** scared from coding because of the, quote on quote **old DEVELOPERS**.
we are in the same path.

I'm not a developer, i am an artist who designs the best mechanic possible at the time around for the deadline. 

I'm not professional, professions you've been looking for, already becomes **Curse** for me.

I'm an athlete which doesnt try to run faster try to run stable.
